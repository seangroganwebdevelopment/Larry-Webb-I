            <h2>About Lara</h2>
            <p>
                Lara Grogan, born in Luxembourg in 2004, grew up immersed in the music of The Beatles,
                Joni Mitchell, Simon and Garfunkel, and Carole King. These artists shaped her love for
                storytelling and inspired her to explore how music can connect people to emotions and
                ideas. Over the years, Lara has developed her own unique style, blending elements of pop,
                jazz, and classical music, always driven by her curiosity and creativity.
                Currently she performs with two live music projects, Lara Grogan &amp; Cello and Lara Grogan &amp;
                Band.

                In 2024, Lara released her debut album, The Sculptor, a collection of songs she wrote
                between the ages of 14 and 18. The title track, “The Sculptor,” was a Semi-Finalist in the
                Singer-Songwriter category of the UK Songwriting Contest 2023. In 2022, she composed and
                performed City and Its People, a piece created for the opening of Esch 2022, European
                Capital of Culture, as part of the Future Frequencies Project, directed by Matthew Herbert
                (UK) and Frank Wiedemann (Germany).

                Lara is a multilingual artist, who is fluent in five languages, with English as her mother
                tongue. She began writing songs at the age of 11, alongside her early training in piano (since
                age 9) and guitar (since age 11). Her talent quickly gained recognition when, at age 13 and
                14, her original songs ranked among the top five entries in the Screaming Fields Song
                Contest, organized by Rocklab. She later participated in the Screaming Fields Festival at ages
                15 and 17, winning several prizes such as the Booker’s Choice awards from the National
                Youth Service (SNJ) in 2019, the Rotondes in 2021, and Abbaye Neimenster in 2021, as well
                as the Songwriter Package from the Grund Club in 2021.
                Since October 2024, Lara has been studying songwriting at the Hochschule für Musik und
                Tanz in Cologne / Germany.
